Control your Kubernetes cluster through natural conversation - now with local speech processing and drastically reduced costs! KubeWhisper Hybrid combines local speech-to-text, affordable cloud LLMs, and high-quality voice synthesis to make voice-controlled Kubernetes accessible to everyone.

Read the full story behind KubeWhisper Hybrid in my [Medium article](https://medium.com/p/70c9345eb8c3).

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Cost-Effective**: Up to 90% cheaper than the original version through hybrid architecture
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Local speech processing keeps your voice data on your machine
- **Natural Voice Control**: Talk to your cluster like you're chatting with a colleague
- **Smart Command Translation**: Automatically converts speech to the right kubectl commands
- **High-Quality Voice**: Crystal clear responses using ElevenLabs text-to-speech
- **Secure by Design**: Uses your existing kubectl credentials and permissions
- **Fully Documented API**: Easy to extend with your own custom commands

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

KubeWhisper Hybrid uses a three-part architecture to optimize for both cost and privacy:

1. **Local Speech-to-Text**: Uses mlx-whisper for fast, private voice transcription on your machine
2. **Cloud LLM**: Leverages DeepSeek V3 for accurate, cost-effective command understanding
3. **Voice Synthesis**: Employs ElevenLabs for natural-sounding responses

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- A configured Kubernetes cluster
- A DeepSeek API key
- An ElevenLabs API key (optional, but recommended for voice output)
- A decent microphone

### Installation

1. **Install UV** (if you haven't already):
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Clone & Navigate**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PatrickKalkman/kube-whisper-hybrid
cd kube-whisper-hybrid
```

3. **Set API Keys**:
```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your-deepseek-api-key-here'
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY='your-elevenlabs-api-key-here'
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Text mode (direct questions)
uv run kubewhisper -t "show me all pods in default namespace"

# Voice mode
uv run kubewhisper --voice

# Voice mode with specific input device
uv run kubewhisper --voice --device <device_index>

# Voice mode with voice output
uv run kubewhisper --voice --output voice

# Verbose output
uv run kubewhisper -v --text "show all my services"
```

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

- **Original Version**: $10-20 per day of regular use
- **Hybrid Version**: ~$1.50 per day + free tier ElevenLabs

## üîí Security

KubeWhisper Hybrid is designed with security in mind:

- Uses your existing Kubernetes RBAC permissions
- Function-based access control for commands
- Local voice processing for enhanced privacy
- No permanent storage of voice data

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending KubeWhisper

Adding new commands is simple with our decorator-based system:

```python
@FunctionRegistry.register(
    description="Get the logs from a specified pod",
    response_template="The logs from pod {pod} in namespace {namespace} are: {logs}"
)
async def get_pod_logs(pod_name: str, namespace: str = "default"):
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```

## üîÆ Future Plans

- Full local LLM support
- Custom fine-tuned models for better command recognition
- Multi-language support
- Expanded command library
- Local text-to-speech options
